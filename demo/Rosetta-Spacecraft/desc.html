<p>
    This demo is created using photos captured by <em>Rosetta Spacecraft</em> (<a href="http://rosetta.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/images/comet-67p/churyumov-gerasimenko" target="_blank">source</a>).
</p>

<p>
    Structure from Motion of this demo is incomplete, not enough matches are found between the images.<br/>
    This can be solved by adding manual matching into the application.
</p>

<p>
    SIFT features are generated from <em>WebSIFT</em> (WebSFM&#39;s javascript implementation of SIFT).
</p>

<p>
    Feature matches are generated by <em>WebMatcher</em> (WebSFM&#39;s javascript implementation of kd-tree based ANN matcher).
