    This demo is created from Leuven cityhall image set (<a href="http://cvlab.epfl.ch/data/strechamvs" target="_blank">source</a>).

<p>
    3D reconstruction of this demo is complete. <br/>
    SIFT features are generated from WebSIFT (WebSFM&#39;s javascript implementation of SIFT);<br/>
    Feature matches are generated by WebMatcher (WebSFM&#39;s javascript implementation of kd-tree based ANN matcher);<br/>
    Sparse reconstruction is recovered by WebRegister (WebSFM&#39;s javascript implementation of Bundler and Sparse Bundle Adjustment), the initial pair of camera is still unstable;<br/>
    Dense reconstruction is generated by Yasutaka Furukawa&#39;s PMVS (<a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/pmvs/">source</a>), WebSFM&#39;s implementation of PMVS is still under construction;
