<p>
    Structure-from-Motion of this demo is complete:
</p>

<p>
    SIFT features are generated from WebSIFT (WebSFM&#39;s javascript implementation of SIFT).
</p>

<p>
    Feature matches are generated by WebMatcher (WebSFM&#39;s javascript implementation of kd-tree based ANN matcher).
</p>

<p>
    Sparse reconstruction is recovered by WebRegister (WebSFM&#39;s javascript implementation of Bundler and Sparse Bundle Adjustment),
    the initial pair of camera is still unstable.
</p>

<p>
    Dense reconstruction is generated by Yasutaka Furukawa&#39;s PMVS (<a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/pmvs/">source</a>),
    WebSFM&#39;s implementation of PMVS is still under construction.
