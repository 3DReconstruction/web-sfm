    This demo is created from Leuven cityhall image set (<a target="_blank" href="http://cvlab.epfl.ch/data/strechamvs">source</a>).

<p>
    Structure-from-Motion of this demo is complete:
</p>

<p>
    SIFT features are generated from <em>WebSIFT</em> (WebSFM&#39;s javascript implementation of SIFT).
</p>

<p>
    Feature matches are generated by <em>WebMatcher</em> (WebSFM&#39;s javascript implementation of kd-tree based ANN matcher).
</p>

<p>
    Sparse reconstruction is recovered by <em>WebRegister</em> (WebSFM&#39;s javascript implementation of Bundler and Sparse Bundle Adjustment),
    the initial pair of camera is still unstable.
</p>

<p>
    Dense reconstruction is generated by Yasutaka Furukawa&#39;s <em>PMVS</em> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.di.ens.fr/pmvs/">source</a>),
    WebSFM&#39;s implementation of PMVS is still under construction.
